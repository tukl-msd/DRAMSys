**DRAMSys** is a flexible DRAM subsystem design space exploration framework based on SystemC TLM-2.0. It was developed by the [Microelectronic Systems Design Research Group](https://eit.rptu.de/en/fgs/ems/home/seite) at [RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau](https://rptu.de/en/), by [Fraunhofer IESE](https://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/en.html) and by the [Computer Engineering Group](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ce/) at [JMU Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/home/).

## Trace Analyzer Consulting and Custom-Tailored Modifications

To provide better analysis capabilities for DRAM subsystem design space exploration than the usual performance-related outputs to the console, DRAMSys offers the Trace Analyzer.

All requests, responses and DRAM commands can be recorded in an SQLite trace database during a simulation and visualized with the tool afterwards. An evaluation of the trace databases can be performed with the powerful Python interface of the Trace Analyzer. Different metrics are described as SQL statements and formulas in Python, which can be customized or extended without recompilation.

The Trace Analyzer's main window is shown below.

A basic version of Trace Analyzer is included in the open source release of DRAMSys.
However, the full version of the Trace Analyzer includes many additional analysis features:
- Detailed transaction-level latency analysis
- Power, bandwidth, and buffer utilization analysis over simulation time intervals
- Timing dependency analysis at the DRAM command level
- Calculation of numerous predefined and user-defined metrics
- VCD export of generated trace

If you are interested in the full version of Trace Analyzer, if you need support with the setup of DRAMSys in a virtual platform of your company, or if you require custom modifications of the simulator please contact [DRAMSys@iese.fraunhofer.de](mailto:DRAMSys@iese.fraunhofer.de).

## Basic Setup

To use DRAMSys, first clone the repository.

### Dependencies

DRAMSys requires a **C++17** compiler. The build process is based on **CMake** (minimum version **3.24**). Furthermore, the simulator is based on **SystemC**. SystemC is included with FetchContent and will be build automatically with the project. If you want to use a preinstalled SystemC version, export the environment variable `SYSTEMC_HOME` (SystemC installation directory) and enable the `DRAMSYS_USE_EXTERNAL_SYSTEMC` CMake option. Also make sure that the SystemC library was built with the same C++ version.

If you choose to enable the compilation of the Trace Analyzer, a system installation of development packages for Qt5, Qwt and Python is required.
For example, on Ubuntu, these dependencies can be satisfied by installing the `qtbase5-dev`, `libqwt-qt5-dev` and `python3-dev` packages.

### Building DRAMSys

To build the standalone simulator for running memory trace files or traffic generators, first configure the project using CMake, then build the project:

```console
$ cd DRAMSys
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build
```

If you plan to integrate DRAMSys into your own SystemC TLM-2.0 project you can build only the DRAMSys library by disabling the CMake option `DRAMSYS_BUILD_CLI`.

To include the Trace Analyzer in the build process, enable the CMake option `DRAMSYS_BUILD_TRACE_ANALYZER`.

In order to include any proprietary extensions such as the extended features of Trace Analyzer, enable the CMake option `DRAMSYS_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS`.

To build DRAMSys on Windows 10 we recommend to use the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.

### Executing DRAMSys

From the build directory use the commands below to execute the DRAMSys standalone.

```console
$ cd bin
$ ./DRAMSys
```

The default configuration file is *ddr4-example.json* located in *configs/*, the default folder for all nested configuration files is *configs/*.

To run DRAMSys with a specific configuration file:

```console
$ ./DRAMSys ../../configs/lpddr4-example.json
```

To run DRAMSys with a specific configuration file and configuration folder:

```console
$ ./DRAMSys ../../tests/tests_regression/DDR3/ddr3-example.json ../../tests/tests_regression/DDR3/
```

More information on the configuration can be found [here](configs/README.md).

## gem5 Coupling

There are two ways to couple DRAMSys with **gem5**:
- Use the official integration of DRAMSys in gem5. More information can be found in `ext/dramsys` of the gem5 repository.
- (Deprecated) Compile gem5 as a shared library and link it with DRAMSys, which is only supported in older versions of DRAMSys (tag v4.0).

## Development

Some additional development sources required for tests may be obtained using Git LFS.
Make sure to have Git LFS installed through your system's package manager and set up for your user:
```console
$ git lfs install
```

To make the additional files available, run:
```console
$ git lfs pull
```
